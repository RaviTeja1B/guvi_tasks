      HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server
      communication.<br />
      By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the
      response to the user. <br />
      There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly
      on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was
      created in 2015.

        <h1>HTTP1.1</h1>
        <p>
          Previously, HTTP/1.1 was the major version of HTTP network protocol
          used by the World Wide Web, implemented across clients and servers.
          That worked well for 15 years. But as modern day applications and
          websites evolved and the amount of data to be loaded on a single page
          increased, the shortcomings of HTTP/1.1 became more prominent.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="http2_style">
        <h1>HTTP2</h1>
        <p>
          HTTP/2 was built over Google’s SPDY protocol kept in mind the
          disadvantages of HTTP/1.1.
